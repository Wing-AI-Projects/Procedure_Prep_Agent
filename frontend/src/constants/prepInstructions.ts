COLONOSCOPY PREPARATION INSTRUCTIONS

Thank you for choosing us for your care. PLEASE READ THESE INSTRUCTIONS AT LEAST ONE WEEK PRIOR TO YOUR PROCEDURE.

TRANSPORTATION

Your driver must be a responsible adult (18+) and stay with you for 4 hours post procedure at home. On the day of your procedure, your driver must check in with you and provide a valid working phone number. This is to ensure proper communication with the doctor and the nurse when the procedure is complete, and you are ready to be picked up. The wait time for your driver may be up to 3 hours, and we ask that they remain 15 minutes from the facility.

Arranging transportation is necessary, we will not perform your procedure if you have driven yourself or have not arranged a ride home. If needed, a list of concierge transportation services can be provided upon request. If you plan to take a taxi/Lyft/Uber, or transportation arranged through your insurance, you must still be accompanied by a responsible adult to/from the facility and arrange for after-care at home.

PRE-PROCEDURE SCREENING

An important step in preparing you for your procedures is the pre-procedure screening. A registered nurse will call you 1-3 days prior to your procedure between 8am and 4pm. They will review pre-procedure instructions, what to expect during your recovery, and any concern regarding your comfort post procedure.

MEDICATIONS

Take your blood pressure or heart medications the morning of the procedure with only a sip of water.

If you are currently taking BLOOD THINNERS (Plavix, Coumadin, Warfarin, Xarelto, Pradaxa, Eliquis, Effient, Aggrenox, Clopidogrel), please make sure you receive instructions from our office on when to stop. You may take Tylenol and Aspirin.

If you are DIABETIC, and take oral diabetic medicine, please do not take oral diabetic medicines the day before or the day of your procedure. Do not take non-insulin injectable medicines on the day of your procedure. If you are taking insulin, please contact the Doctor who prescribed your insulin for pre-procedure instructions.
